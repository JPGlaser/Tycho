# Tycho
AMUSE community code for observing star-star scattering effects on exoplanets in stellar clusters.

TYCHO is a simulation suite used in observing the effects of star-star scattering on exoplanets within clustered natal environments. It is dependent on multiple community codes provided by the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE; amusecode.org).

## Breakdown of Included Scripts
- **sim_cluster.py:** Used in simulating a star cluster according to user-defined initial conditions. Additionally, it records all stellar close-encounters into an easy to process pickle format. If desired, this can also include a Jovian population to track the sub-brown dwarf population in the cluster.
- **cut_encounters.py:** Used to place predefined data cuts on the close-encounter database generated by *sim_cluster.py*.
- **gen_RandEncounters.py:** Used to create the starting conditions for *sim_encounters.py* by generating random orientations of the desired planetary systems for each encounter specified in the reduced encounter database.
- **sim_encounters.py:** Used in simulating stellar close-encounters created and stored by *gen_RandEncounters.py*.
- **gen_init-final_database.py:** A useful script which generates the initial and final conditions of planetary systems after *sim_encounters.py* has been run.
