# Tycho
AMUSE community code for observing star-star scattering effects on exoplanets in stellar clusters.

TYCHO is a simulation suite used in observing the effects of star-star scattering on exoplanets within clustered natal environments. It is dependent on multiple community codes provided by the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE; amusecode.org).

Breakdown of Files:
    - sim_cluster.py ~ Used in simulating a star cluster and record all close-encounters.
    - sim_encounters.py ~ Used in simulating stellar close-encounters created and stored by sim_cluster.py
    - plot_encounters.py ~ Used to plot stellar close-encounters.
